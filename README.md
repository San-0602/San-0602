# 👋 Hey, I’m San  

> 404: Sleep not found — but the code runs fine.  

BCA student @ **Jain (Deemed-to-be University)**  
Building things that shouldn’t work… but do.  



### ⚙️ Tech Stack  
**Languages & Frameworks:** Dart, Flutter, Python (Flask), JavaScript, Astro  
**Databases:** MongoDB, SQL, Neo4j  
**Design & Styling:** Tailwind CSS, HTML5, JSON  

I like logic clean, UI cleaner, and error messages dramatic.



### 🚀 What I’m Doing
- Developing apps that mix **creativity and computation**  
- Exploring **AI**, **Cloud**, and **Open-Source** ecosystems  
- Turning caffeine into commits and chaos into structure  



### 💬 Motto  
> “Some build projects. I build problems until they become projects.”  



### 🕶️ Currently  
Working on something you’ll probably bookmark later.
